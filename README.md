# Asset Administration Shell-Based OCL Validation Framework for Model-Based System Engineering

This repository contains all models, files, and scripts developed as part of the research work described in the paper:
“Asset Administration Shell-Based Object Constraint Language Validation Framework for Model-Based System Engineering”

The study presents a complete workflow for managing semantic OCL constraints  using the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as a central integration layer in context of Model Based System Engineering. The approach demonstrates how constraints can be validated over model instances and how the results can be integrated into AASs for interoperability, transparency, and machine processing across industrial systems like Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), digital twins and domain systems.

# Methodology Summary
The workflow integrates automatic constraint validation for systems's semantic models with AAS technology through the following steps:

1. Fetch and transform AML models into EMF-compatible .ecore and .xmi formats.
2. Apply OCL constraints to model instances.
3. Generate validation result logs.
4. Serialize results into JSON or XML.
5. Store all related files inside AAS submodels for interoperability and machine processing.

The process is supported by a dedicated OCL Validation Component (OVC), currently under development.

# Dependencies
1. AutomationML
2. Asset Administration Shell (AAS)
3. Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
4. Eclipse OCL Plugin
5. Python 3.11+
6. Eclipse BaSyx (for AAS handling)


# How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open .aml files using AML or xml editors to see meta and instance information of the example.
3. Open the .ecore (OCLinEcore) and .xmi files using Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
4. Apply OCL constraints (using EMF OCL Plugin).
5. Run ResultSerializationJSON.py to convert validation logs (generated in EMF Validity View) to JSON format.
6. Explore AAS integration structure using Eclipse BaSyx or any AAS-compatible platform.
